# Prefix-css
Prefix can manage or handle your website default CSS and help to code easily, Basically it is your reset or normalizer CSS with some new CSS code.



# How To Use

1. Use `<mid> </mid>` tag with width to make a box in center that's all.

2. Don't write display block and float left for any element (Don't worry I'll do this for you).

3. Add prefix on top in your head tag to load first.

4. Note:- Use only when you are going to start development of your website.
